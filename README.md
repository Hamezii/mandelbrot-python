# Mandelbot Explorer

Its mandelbrot!

Decided to do when I was bored, and slowly added more things.

Run `mandelbrot_explorer.pyw` to start the program. Python 3 and Pygame modules are required.

## Controls:
Click - Set start and end of selection box

Space - zoom to selection box

I - set number of iterations for mandelbrot approximation

P - set pixel density (size of drawn pixels)

R - reset all parameters and zoom

F1 - save a screenshot


Enter - Confirm

Esc - Remove selection box / Cancel / Exit
